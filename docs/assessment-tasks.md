Provide a getter (property) and a setter method for this value.

#### 3.1.1. Success criteria

- [ ] Correct use of private instance variable
- [ ] Use of properties to create a getter and setter
- [ ] Raising ValueError if someone attempts to set a non-positive value

## 4. Sorting players

### 4.1. Task: Add unit tests for sorting players

Add the following unit tests to the `test_player.py` file:

```python
def test_sort_players(self):
    players = [Player("Alice", uid='01', score=10), Player("Bob", uid='02', score=5), Player("Charlie", uid='03', score=15)]
    # note: ensure initialization code is valid for **your** implementation

    # do **not** change the following code:
    sorted_players = sorted(players)

    # players must be sorted by score as shown here:
    manually_sorted_players == [Player("Bob", uid='02', score=5), Player("Alice", uid='01', score=10), Player("Charlie", uid='03', score=15)]

   self.assertListEqual(sorted_players, manually_sorted_players)

```

> **Note:** If you have made other changes to the initializer of your player update the above code to reflect this change - you must not make any other changes to the test code above.

### 4.2. Task: Interpret unit tests

What was the outcome of running the above unit test, copy paste the output **for just this particular test** below:

```text
Ran 1 test in 0.028s

FAILED (errors=1)

Error
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\AITMAR\source\repos\SRUS-MA-Games-Hashmap\test\test_player.py", line 11, in test_sort_players
    sorted_players = sorted(players)
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'Player' and 'Player'
```

### 4.3. Success criteria

- [ ] Unit test added to `test_player.py`
- [ ] Unit test output provided
- [ ] Unit test output reflects the error in `sorted(players)` (if you are getting another error read the instructions CAREFULLY)

#### 4.3.1. Question

The tests checks that calling sorted on a list of players will sort them by score, what is the **only** magic method that must be implemented in the player class for the `sorted` function to succeed?

> The only magic method that must be implemented in the Player class for the sorted() function to succeed in sorting by score is __lt__ .
> This method is "less than", used for Pythons sorted() function to compare objects and set them in correct order. 

#### 4.3.2. Task: Implement the magic method in the Player class

Add a test case to test_player to test the comparison operator you are about to add - ensure you do not test a dunder method directly!

```python
def test_players_can_be_compared_by_score(self):
    # note: ensure initialization code is valid for **your** implementation
    alice = Player("Alice", uid='01', score=10)
    bob = Player("Bob", uid='02', score=5)

    # Add the appropriate expression to the following assert test
    self.assertTrue(...)
```

Run the test and confirm that your error resembles the previous error

```text
Error
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Users\AITMAR\source\repos\SRUS-MA-Games-Hashmap\test\test_player.py", line 24, in test_players_can_be_compared_by_score
    self.assertTrue(alice > bob)
                    ^^^^^^^^^^^
TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'Player' and 'Player'



Ran 1 test in 0.005s

FAILED (errors=1)

```

Implement the appropriate magic method in the Player class and ensure you pass this test (and only this test!).

#### 4.3.3. Success criteria

- [ ] Unit test added to `test_player.py`
- [ ] Magic method implemented in `Player` class
- [ ] Initial Failed Unit test output provided
- [ ] Unit test runs successfully with submited code
- [ ] Dunder method not employed directly

#### 4.3.4. Task: Are we sorted yet?

Rerun `test_sort_players` does the test pass? If not, include the output below:

```text

Ran 1 test in 0.006s

FAILED (failures=1)
```

Why did the test fail (note: if it doesn't fail, it means there is something you have already done before you were asked to - you need to figure out what that is!)?

> The test failed because assertListEqual compares the memory addresses of the Player objects, not their values. To fix this, I implement the __eq__ method in the Player class to compare the object values (score) rather than their memory locations.

Add the necessary code to the Player class to ensure that the `test_sort_players` test passes.

#### 4.3.5. Success criteria

- [ ] Correct explanation of why `test_sort_players` failed/passed
- [ ] Correct implementation of the magic method in the `Player` class
- [ ] `test_sort_players` passes when run against the submitted code

## 5. Implement a custom sorting algorithm

The senior developer on your team believes that a custom sorting algorithm would be more efficient than the built-in `sorted` function (you grit your teeth, sigh, and realize you need this job!). They have asked you to implement a custom sorting algorithm that will sort a list of players by score.

To help you get started they have provided you with some example code that they wrote in their undergraduate days:

```python
def sort_quickly(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[0]
    left = []
    right = []
    for x in arr[1:]:
        if x < pivot:
            left.append(x)
        else:
            right.append(x)
    return sort_quickly(left) + [pivot] + sort_quickly(right)
```

### 5.1. Question: complexity

What is the expected time and space complexity of the above algorithm? You can answer using big O or in plain English but in both cases you MUST justify your answer.

>Time Complexity: The algorithm divides the list into smaller parts, which takes time proportional to O(log n). Then, it goes through all the items to sort them, which takes O(n) time. So, the total time it takes is O(n log n). 
> Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(n) because the algorithm needs extra space to store temporary lists while sorting, as well as memory for keeping track of the recursive calls.
>


### 5.2. Task: Implement the custom sorting algorithm

#### 5.2.1. Create a new method in the Player class

Use the sample above (and its algorithm) as a starting point to implement a `classmethod` in the Player class that takes a list of players and returns a list of players sorted by score in **descending** order. Top scores come first!

#### 5.2.2. Create a test cases

Add a separate test case to `test_player.py` to test your custom sorting algorithm

Include your code below:

```python
   @classmethod
    def sort(cls, arr: list) -> list:
        if len(arr) <= 1:
            return arr
        pivot = arr[0]
        left = []
        right = []
        for x in arr[1:]:
            if x > pivot:
                left.append(x)
            else:
                right.append(x)
        return cls.sort(left) + [pivot] + cls.sort(right)
```

#### 5.2.3. Success criteria

- [ ] Custom sorting algorithm implemented in the `Player` class as `classmethod`
- [ ] Custom sorting algorithm sorts in descending order
- [ ] Custom sorting algorithm compares players using their score (via the rich comparison operators)
- [ ] Custom sorting algorithm tested in `test_player.py` and tests passed

### 5.3. Test your custom sorting algorithm at scale

The senior developer is impressed with your work and asks you to test your custom sorting algorithm with a list of 1000 players. They provide you with a script that will generate a list of 1000 players with random scores.

```python
import random
from player import Player


players = [Player(f"Player {i}", uid=f"{i:03}", score=random.randint(0, 1000)) for i in range(1000)]
```

#### 5.3.1. Task: Create a test case to sort 1000 players

Using the code above as a starting point, create a test case to test your custom sort algorithm - you can test it against the `sorted` function to ensure it is working correctly.

Include your test case below:

```python
    def test_players_custom_sorting_algorithm_at_scale(self):
        players = [Player(unique_id=f"{i:03}", player_name=f"Test player {i}", player_score=random.randint(0,1000)) for i in range(1000)]

        sorted_players = Player.sort(players)

        sorted_players_default = sorted(players, reverse=True)
        self.assertListEqual(sorted_players, sorted_players_default)
```

#### 5.3.2. Success criteria

- [ ] Test case added to `test_player.py`
- [ ] Test case sorts 1000 players correctly when compared to `sorted` function
- [ ] Test case passes when run against the submitted code

#### 5.3.3. Task: Testing sorting sorted players

You had a scary thought - and decided to test your custom sorting algorithm against a list of players that are already sorted by score. You are worried that your algorithm might not be efficient in this case.

#### 5.3.4. Task: Create a test case to sort 1000 sorted players

Create a test case that tries to sort 1000 players that are already sorted.

If you get a failure, include the failure below:

```text

    return self.score > other.score
           ^^^^^^^^^^
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
```

Provide a reason why this test failed (if you got recursion errors, you need to explain **why** they occurred).

If your implementation did not fail, you must explain what changes you made to the original algorithm given by the senior developer to ensure that it did not fail.

> The allocation of memory (stack) is called every time a function is invoked (which happens recursively). Each time a function is called, a new frame is added to the stack, and when the function returns, the frame is removed. With deep recursion,  as in this case with 1000 elements, Python stops the programme to prevent memory overflow by exceeding the recursion limit. 
> The original algorithm caused elements to be unevenly distribut when the list was sorted because the pivot was chosen from the middle of the list. In a sorted list, this results in the one side of the partition being much larger than the other, causing deeper recursion. 
> To fix this, I modified the partitioning logic so that the list is split more evenly, even if it is already sorted. This reduces the likelihood of exceeding the recursion depth. However, because it's still a recursive algorithm, we can't fully remove the chance of a recursion error.

Propose a fix to your sorting algorithm that fixes this issue.

```python
    @classmethod
    def sort(cls, arr: list) -> list:
        if len(arr) <= 1:
            return arr

        middle = int(len(arr)/2)
        pivot = arr[middle]   # THIS IS WHERE IT FIXES THE PROBLEM
        left = []
        right = []

        for x in arr[0:]:
            if x > pivot:
                left.append(x)
            else:
                right.append(x)
        return cls.sort(left) + cls.sort(right)
```

#### 5.3.5. Success criteria

- [ ] Test case added to `test_player.py`
- [ ] Test case passes only when changes above are added
